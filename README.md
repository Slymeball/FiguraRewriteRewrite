# Figura

Figura is a Minecraft Java mod that allows you to change your player _extensively_ through the use of **Blockbench** models and **Lua** scripting

Figura is capable of doing almost anything you have in mind with well-documented APIs that interact with the world around you

Figura works in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer, with a custom server storing your avatar so others can see it

If you're concerned someone is cheating or an avatar is too complex for your framerate, you can filter players and tweak their available resources with the **permission system**

**Note:** All avatar rights are reserved to their respective creators

## FAQ

### • My avatars don't appear in the Figura list, even though they're in the correct folder?
> Check if your avatar has a file called "avatar.json" (don't forget to check file extensions)
> 
> This file can be completely empty, it just needs to be present for Figura to recognise it as an avatar

### • How do I hide the vanilla model?
> At the top of your script, put:
>
> • To hide literally everything (player, armor, elytra, held items):
> ```lua
> vanilla_model.ALL:setVisible(false)
> ```
>
> • To hide only the player:
> ```lua
> vanilla_model.PLAYER:setVisible(false)
> ```
>
> • To hide only armor:
> ```lua
> vanilla_model.ARMOR:setVisible(false)
> ```
> 
> • To hide other, or specific parts, you can check the in-game docs

### • How do I play a Blockbench Animation?
> Simply put this code in your script:
> ```lua
> animations.modelName.animationName:play()
> ```
> Where:
> 
> "`animations`" is the global table which contains all animations
> 
> "`modelName`" is the name of the model you are accessing the animation from
> 
> "`animationName`" is, as the name says, the animation name

### • What are Pings and how do I use them?
> Pings are Lua functions that are executed for everyone running your avatar's script
> 
> Pings are sent from the host player, and can be used to sync things like keypresses or action wheel actions
> 
> To create a ping:
> ```lua
> function pings.myPing(arg1, arg2)
>   -- code to run once the ping is called
> end
> ```
> And to execute the ping, it's as shrimple as calling a lua function:
> ```lua
> pings.myPing("Hello", "World")
> ```
> Note that pings are limited in their content and size, and are rate-limited

### • How can I add an emissive texture?
> Name the texture the same as the non-emissive counterpart, then add `_e` to the end
> 
> And don't forget to set the places you don't want to glow to **transparent black** (#00000000), to also ensure compatibility with shader mods

### • My emissives doesn't glow, nor have bloom with Iris shaders?
> Since some shaders doesnt support emissives, a compatibility setting (default on) will change the render type of emissive textures to render them at it were fullbright, however that can lead to some unintended results
>
> You can force your avatar to use the correct emissive render type by using the render type `EYES` on your model

### • How can I use Figura with OptiFine?
> You can't, OptiFine's closed-source nature and invasive code makes mod compatibility very difficult
> 
> Check out these [alternatives](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/) instead

### • Forge port?
> No, however if you want to develop it yourself, feel free to do so

### • Where can I find avatars to download?
> For now you can find avatars in the showcase channel in the official Discord server

### • My Minecraft is cracked (non-premium/non-original), why can't I use Figura?
> Figura uses your account's UUID and your Mojang authentication as a way to prove you own that account, avoiding unwanted / malicious uploads
> 
> Non-premium Minecraft accounts don't authenticate with Mojang, and as such can neither upload nor download Figura avatars
